Why take this certification
If you ever want to learn Jenkins in-depth, this is your goto certification(I am not aware of any other). Knowing a platform like Jenkins in depth would be a precious skill one could have(based on how commonly Jenkins is used as a CI-CD tool). Also, this might be a structured approach to learning something, validating your learning, and using it at your workplace. So itâ€™s a good one for folks with all kinds of experience with Jenkins, in my opinion.

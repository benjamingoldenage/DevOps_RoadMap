[Running a HTTPS Python Server on EC2 in 5 Minutes](https://pancy.medium.com/running-a-https-python-server-on-ec2-in-5-minutes-6c1f0444a0cf)

Here I‚Äôm going to walk you through setting up a running HTTPS API server in Python using FastAPI (trust me, Flask is so 2008) and Caddy web server (this one is a total replacement to NGINX and gives you automatic HTTPS, saving you from the pain of setting up TLS certificate).
ü§∑ Tips: Hold it if you are tempted to Dockerize your app for your first Product Hunt launch or Hacker News show and tell. You‚Äôre distracted.

[AWS Solution Architect Professional ‚Äî Exam tips -2021](https://medium.com/startcloudnow/aws-solution-architect-professional-exam-tips-2021-9dee760f20ec)

I recently had to recertify my AWS Solution Architect Professional exam. AWS is very nice in that they give you three years to recertify. Even though it‚Äôs three years preparing for recertification can be stressful. If you choose not to recertify I can understand but if you plan on keeping it well let just say on AWS a lot of things change fast.

My preparation for this exam was very very stressful mainly because I had done a series of exams in December 2020 and this was my first for 2021 so my brain needed a rest. This exam is the real deal it covers the full gambit. From my experience, this is the rabbit hole I had to face. It covered topics like, storage, analytics, networking, compute, database types, migration, security both services and policy, serverless, Amazon FSx, API stuff, Appsec, Organisations, IAM, and more.

[AWS Solutions Architect: Exam Question Deep Dive](https://codeburst.io/aws-solutions-architect-exam-question-deep-dive-d9ea49479a11)

As I have prepared for AWS exams, I found dissecting exam questions helpful to grow my AWS knowledge. This post is a bite-sized study guide that will hopefully expand your knowledge of AWS and help you on your journey to becoming a Solutions Architect as well.

For each post in this series, I am choosing one AWS Solutions Architect Professional exam question. We will explore the required knowledge and strategy to find the right answer and learn about a few AWS services along the way.

[AWS Application Load Balancer algorithms](https://medium.com/dazn-tech/aws-application-load-balancer-algorithms-765be2eca158)

All load balancers support some balancing algorithms. These algorithms define which target handles each request. They‚Äôre often ignored, but choosing the correct balancing algorithm can have a big impact on your application performance. The most common algorithms are round-robin and least connections, known as Least Outstanding Requests by AWS. Let‚Äôs take a look at how each of these work.


[CloudWatch vs CloudTrail](https://digitalcloud.training/cloudwatch-vs-cloudtrail-comparison/)

`Two of the most important ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù services to know for your exam are Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail`. You may have already heard of these services before because they‚Äôre quite popular on AWS (for a good reason). They‚Äôre popular because they both perform a very important function. With ‚ÄúWatch‚Äù and ‚ÄúTrail‚Äù at the end of the name, can you guess what essential function it is that they perform?

You got it, monitoring!

[A Cloud Migration Questionnaire for Solution Architects](https://betterprogramming.pub/a-cloud-migration-questionnaire-for-solution-architects-dec7ffcf063e#28dc)

Many companies operating from their own data centers started migrating their applications to the cloud, and it has become an obvious choice for many startups to create cloud-native applications. This is most important because of the speed of time to market and cost-efficiency in addition to many other benefits of the cloud.

As a solution architect, you need to ask relevant questions to gather the required information from customers. The solution you build based on this information from the customer lays the foundation for future design solutions and migrations.

[AWS Solution Architect Associate Exam Study Notes
](https://chloemcateer.medium.com/aws-solution-architect-associate-exam-study-notes-b6c5884ee500)

While studying for my exam I created a tonne of notes to break down and understand all of the different services.
Before sitting the exam, I took my notes and created high level summaries for each service and I have decided to share each of these summaries through blogs!

One thing to note is that these are just overall summaries, so I would not recommend solely using these for your studies, but to use as an overview or as some reading to do the week of your exam.

[AWS ‚Äî Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) Overview](https://medium.com/awesome-cloud/aws-elastic-load-balancer-elb-overview-introduction-to-aws-elb-alb-nlb-gwlb-e2820fe8fe27)

AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones. It monitors the health of its registered targets, and routes traffic only to the healthy targets. Elastic Load Balancing scales your load balancer as your incoming traffic changes over time. It can automatically scale to the vast majority of workloads.

[Running a HTTPS Python Server on EC2 in 5 Minutes](https://pancy.medium.com/running-a-https-python-server-on-ec2-in-5-minutes-6c1f0444a0cf)

Here I‚Äôm going to walk you through setting up a running HTTPS API server in Python using FastAPI (trust me, Flask is so 2008) and Caddy web server (this one is a total replacement to NGINX and gives you automatic HTTPS, saving you from the pain of setting up TLS certificate).

[AWS Solution Architect Professional ‚Äî Exam tips -2021](https://medium.com/startcloudnow/aws-solution-architect-professional-exam-tips-2021-9dee760f20ec)

I recently had to recertify my AWS Solution Architect Professional exam. AWS is very nice in that they give you three years to recertify. Even though it‚Äôs three years preparing for recertification can be stressful. If you choose not to recertify I can understand but if you plan on keeping it well let just say on AWS a lot of things change fast.

My preparation for this exam was very very stressful mainly because I had done a series of exams in December 2020 and this was my first for 2021 so my brain needed a rest. This exam is the real deal it covers the full gambit. From my experience, this is the rabbit hole I had to face. It covered topics like, storage, analytics, networking, compute, database types, migration, security both services and policy, serverless, Amazon FSx, API stuff, Appsec, Organisations, IAM, and more.

[AWS Solutions Architect: Exam Question Deep Dive](https://codeburst.io/aws-solutions-architect-exam-question-deep-dive-d9ea49479a11)

As I have prepared for AWS exams, I found dissecting exam questions helpful to grow my AWS knowledge. This post is a bite-sized study guide that will hopefully expand your knowledge of AWS and help you on your journey to becoming a Solutions Architect as well.

For each post in this series, I am choosing one AWS Solutions Architect Professional exam question. We will explore the required knowledge and strategy to find the right answer and learn about a few AWS services along the way.

[AWS Application Load Balancer algorithms](https://medium.com/dazn-tech/aws-application-load-balancer-algorithms-765be2eca158)

All load balancers support some balancing algorithms. These algorithms define which target handles each request. They‚Äôre often ignored, but choosing the correct balancing algorithm can have a big impact on your application performance. The most common algorithms are round-robin and least connections, known as Least Outstanding Requests by AWS. Let‚Äôs take a look at how each of these work.


[CloudWatch vs CloudTrail](https://digitalcloud.training/cloudwatch-vs-cloudtrail-comparison/)

`Two of the most important ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù services to know for your exam are Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail`. You may have already heard of these services before because they‚Äôre quite popular on AWS (for a good reason). They‚Äôre popular because they both perform a very important function. With ‚ÄúWatch‚Äù and ‚ÄúTrail‚Äù at the end of the name, can you guess what essential function it is that they perform?

You got it, monitoring!

[A Cloud Migration Questionnaire for Solution Architects](https://betterprogramming.pub/a-cloud-migration-questionnaire-for-solution-architects-dec7ffcf063e#28dc)

Many companies operating from their own data centers started migrating their applications to the cloud, and it has become an obvious choice for many startups to create cloud-native applications. This is most important because of the speed of time to market and cost-efficiency in addition to many other benefits of the cloud.

As a solution architect, you need to ask relevant questions to gather the required information from customers. The solution you build based on this information from the customer lays the foundation for future design solutions and migrations.

[AWS Solution Architect Associate Exam Study Notes
](https://chloemcateer.medium.com/aws-solution-architect-associate-exam-study-notes-b6c5884ee500)

While studying for my exam I created a tonne of notes to break down and understand all of the different services.
Before sitting the exam, I took my notes and created high level summaries for each service and I have decided to share each of these summaries through blogs!

One thing to note is that these are just overall summaries, so I would not recommend solely using these for your studies, but to use as an overview or as some reading to do the week of your exam.

[AWS ‚Äî Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) Overview](https://medium.com/awesome-cloud/aws-elastic-load-balancer-elb-overview-introduction-to-aws-elb-alb-nlb-gwlb-e2820fe8fe27)

AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones. It monitors the health of its registered targets, and routes traffic only to the healthy targets. Elastic Load Balancing scales your load balancer as your incoming traffic changes over time. It can automatically scale to the vast majority of workloads.

[Preparing For AWS Interview Questions](https://neal-davis.medium.com/preparing-for-aws-interview-questions-ac493da5f60a)

Preparing well for an AWS interview is a great way to gain confidence and gain an edge over your competition. AWS interview questions can be tricky and cover more than just the technical aspects of the AWS Cloud. You need to ensure you have practiced your responses in advance.

In this blog, we have explored that AWS Systems Manager has the ability to automate tasks and helps in keeping all our EC2 instances healthy, applications managed, secure and updated. We have also seen how we can make use of Amazon Systems Manager to execute a bunch of commands remotely on EC2 instances eliminating the need of SSH or bastion hosts. We will discuss more of Amazon Systems Manager and its other configurations in our upcoming blog. Stay tuned to keep getting all updates about our upcoming new blogs on AWS and relevant technologies.

[5 AWS Services You Should Avoid!](https://medium.com/teamzerolabs/5-aws-services-you-should-avoid-f45111cc10cd)

Get ready for some personal and definitely opinionated opinions!
AWS comes with many components that cover different areas of concerns. But, most are not general purpose and cheap enough to be applied correctly. Used in the wrong context, they end up wasting time, resources, money, and will create developer friction and frustrations for months.

Here are the top 5 AWS Services you should avoid:
- Cognito
- CloudFormation
- ElasticCache
- Kinesis
- Lambda

[How to pass AWS Solutions Architect Professional Exam?](https://medium.com/@talhaocakci/how-to-pass-aws-solutions-architect-professional-exam-87bebfdae86f)

First things first: Passing the exam does not mean you are a solutions architect. Second, the real target is to be a solutions architect, not a plain certificate holder. So, a certificate may be required but not sufficient for real job.

If we agree on it, we may talk about the details of both exam and AWS environment and how AWS certification exam evaluates you. By the way, I have prepared for the associate exam with this course. I highly recommend it.

[8 Interesting AWS Services](https://medium.com/devops-dudes/8-interesting-aws-services-3f802e2a7db8)

I‚Äôve used a lot of AWS services lately, and I‚Äôve come across multiple interesting services in AWS.

[AWS CloudFormation: Create a VPC with EC2 Instance](https://aws.plainenglish.io/aws-cloudformation-create-a-vpc-with-ec2-instance-34e27d59a842)

AWS CloudFormation, an Infrastructure as Code service, includes a template made up of nine sections. Although made up of nine sections, the Resources section is the only one required. For this project we will be using Mappings, Resources, and Outputs. I‚Äôve broken my template down to explain what is going on in each section, but if you want to jump straight to the full CloudFormation Template feel free to skip to the end.

[S3 vs EBS vs EFS ‚Äî Comparing AWS Storage Services](https://neal-davis.medium.com/s3-vs-ebs-vs-efs-comparing-aws-storage-services-76080002cb49)

AWS offers many services, so many that it can often get pretty confusing for beginners and experts alike. This is especially true when it comes to the many storage options AWS provides its users. Knowing the benefits and use cases of AWS storage services will help you design the best solution. In this article, we‚Äôll be looking at S3 vs EBS vs EFS.

## Running a HTTPS Python Server on EC2 in 5 Minutes
Here Iâ€™m going to walk you through setting up a running HTTPS API server in Python using FastAPI (trust me, Flask is so 2008) and Caddy web server (this one is a total replacement to NGINX and gives you automatic HTTPS, saving you from the pain of setting up TLS certificate).
ðŸ¤· Tips: Hold it if you are tempted to Dockerize your app for your first Product Hunt launch or Hacker News show and tell. Youâ€™re distracted.

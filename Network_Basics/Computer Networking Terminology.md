COMPUTER NETWORK<br>
A collection of computers, servers, network devices connected to each other to share data. The devices on a network linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, or satellites. It has to be connection between each other. 

LAN<br>
A network in a single location is called Local Area Network(LAN). A home or office network is an example of a LAN.

WAN<br>
WAN stands for Wide Area Network. A network that is much more extensive than a LAN located on different geographic locations. WANs cover large geographical areas. 

NODE <br>
Any device that is  attached to a network, and is part of receiving, creating, or transmitting information. It is not necessary for a node to be a computer, it can be any communication device such as a printer, servers, modems, etc.. A node on a wireless network often called STATION.

HOST<br>
A host has to have IP address to function on the network. Every host is a node but every node is not a host. A host includes clients and servers in order to send or receive data. 

SERVERS<br>
Servers are powerful computers. Servers are highly specialized and handle important labor-intensive jobs. In order to get better performance, a single task is often assigned to a dedicated server.(file server, mail server, print server, web server, etc.)

BACKBONE<br>
A fast link among other segments of a network. 

TRANSMISSION MEDIA<br>
A link between network nodes is created using some form of transmission media like cables, or radio waves. 

TOPOLOGY<br>
The arrangement  or layout of nodes of a computer network. Types of topologies are: Bus, Star, Ring, Mesh, Tree, Point-to-Point, Point-to-multipoint, Hybrid.

PYHSICAL TOPOLOGY<br>
Placement of various nodes.

LOGICAL TOPOLOGY<br>
Deals with the data flow in the network.

TWISTED PAIR CABLE<br>
Twisted pair cable connects dissimilar and similar devices together. Twisting two wires as a pair minimizes interference and even protects against interference from outside sources. 

UTP<br>
UTP stands for Unshielded twisted pair(UTP). UTP is common in Ethernet installations.

STP<br>
STP stands for shielded twisted pair(STP). STP is used in various kinds of networks to prevent crosstalk and electromagnetic interference. 

FIBER-OPTIC CABLE<br>
Optical fiber is a very thin strand of pure glass that acts as a waveguide for light over long distances. Fiber optic cable is actually composed of two layers of glass: The core which is thinner than hair carries the actual light signal, and the cladding is a layer of a glass surrounding the core. There are two types of optic cables: SMF and MMF

SMF<br>
SMF stands for Single-Mode Fiber. SMF has a very narrow core which allows only a single mode of light to propagate. 

MMF<br>
MMF stands for Multi-Mode Fiber. MMF has a much wider core, allowing multiple modes(or "rays") of light ot propagate.

EMI stands for electromagnetic interference, which is any electrical disturbance that causes performance failure in a component.

RFI is radio frequency interference and occurs from electrical disturbance within the radio frequency spectrum.

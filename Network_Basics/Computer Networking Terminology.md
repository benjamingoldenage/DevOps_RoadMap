<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSodBEAJz9Y">COMPUTER NETWORK</a><br>
A collection of computers, servers, network devices connected to each other to share data. The devices on a network linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, or satellites. It has to be connection between each other. 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxO4WQzdOfA">LAN</a><br>
A network in a single location is called Local Area Network(LAN). A home or office network is an example of a LAN. Usually restricted to a particular geographic region. Unlike a WAN, a LAN may reside in only a single location. 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxO4WQzdOfA">WAN</a><br>
WAN stands for Wide Area Network. A network that is much more extensive than a LAN located on different geographic locations. WANs cover large geographical areas. WAN is an internetwork that connects multiple sites and spans large geographic regions. Usually employ both routers and public links. 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxcc6ycZ73M&t=10s">INTERNET </a><br>
Internet is considered the largest WAN in the world. A distributed packet-switched network.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uOgH2J4MzQ>">NODE</a> <br>
Point of connection, communication end-point. Any device that is  attached to a network, and is part of receiving, creating, or transmitting information. It is not necessary for a node to be a computer, it can be any communication device such as a printer, servers, modems, etc.. A node on a wireless network often called STATION.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwfTpGVa2wE">HOST</a><br>
A host has to have IP address to function on the network. Every host is a node but every node is not a host. A host includes clients and servers in order to send or receive data.

WORKSTATION <br>
Powerful computer designed for technical or scientific applications. Used by one person at a time.  

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjCDWCeHCzY&t=75s">SERVER</a> <br>
Servers are powerful computers. Servers are highly specialized and handle important labor-intensive jobs. In order to get better performance, a single task is often assigned to a dedicated server.(file server, mail server, print server, web server, etc.)

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwfTpGVa2wE">CLIENT</a><br>
A device that makes request from a server.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo4KlIFSPBo">TRANSMISSION MEDIA</a> <br>
A communication channel between nodes that carries the information from sender to the receiver. Data is transmitted throught the electromagnetic signals.A link between network nodes is created using some form of transmission media like cables, or radio waves. 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZOY0yczVAA">BACKBONE</a><br>
A fast link among other segments of a network. Core infrastructure. Connects multiple networks, buildings, campuses and over geopgraphies. Actually a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNQRssp34wQ">backbone network</a> allows multiple LANs to get connected.  

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbqrNg4C98U&t=129s">TOPOLOGY</a><br>
The arrangement  or layout of nodes of a computer network. Types of topologies are: Bus, Star, Ring, Mesh, Tree, Point-to-Point, Point-to-multipoint, Hybrid.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbqrNg4C98U&t=129s">PYHSICAL TOPOLOGY</a><br>
Placement of various nodes.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbqrNg4C98U&t=129s">LOGICAL TOPOLOGY</a><br>
Deals with the data flow in the network.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NX99ad2FUA">TWISTED PAIR CABLE</a><br>
Twisted pair cable connects dissimilar and similar devices together. Twisting two wires as a pair minimizes interference and even protects against interference from outside sources. 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NX99ad2FUA">UTP</a><br>
UTP stands for Unshielded twisted pair(UTP). UTP is common in Ethernet installations.The wires are twisted to prevent electromagnetic interference(crosstalk).

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NX99ad2FUA">STP</a><br>
STP stands for shielded twisted pair(STP). STP is used in various kinds of networks to prevent crosstalk and electromagnetic interference. The foil shield adds a layer of protection against electro-magnetic interference leaking into and out of the cable.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNa97A08wyU">FIBER-OPTIC CABLE</a><br>
A type of cable that contains one or more optical fibers that are used to carry light. Optical fiber is a very thin strand of pure glass that acts as a waveguide for light over long distances. Fiber optic cable is actually composed of two layers of glass: The core which is thinner than hair carries the actual light signal, and the cladding is a layer of a glass surrounding the core. There are two types of optic cables: SMF and MMF

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNa97A08wyU">SMF</a><br>
SMF stands for Single-Mode Fiber. SMF has a very narrow core which allows only a single mode of light to propagate. 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNa97A08wyU">MMF</a><br>
MMF stands for Multi-Mode Fiber. MMF has a much wider core, allowing multiple modes(or "rays") of light ot propagate. 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3RBb8wmB2E">EMI</a><br>
EMI stands for electromagnetic interference, which is any electrical disturbance that causes performance failure in a component.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3RBb8wmB2E">RFI</a> <br>
RFI is radio frequency interference and occurs from electrical disturbance within the radio frequency spectrum.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mad4kQ5835Y">MODEM</a> <br>
Modem demodulates incoming analog signals into a digital signal. Modem modulates outgoing digital signals into an analog signal.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mad4kQ5835Y">ROUTER</a> <br>
A router is what routes or passes your internet connection to all of your devices. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z0ULvg_pW8&t=129s">Router </a>routes data from one network to another based on their IP address. A layer 3 (Network) device: separates collision domains, separates broadcast domains, forward IP packets across different networks, No routers, no Internet. 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mad4kQ5835Y">MODEM/ROUTER DEVICE</a> <br>
A modem/router device would have a modem with a built-in wireless router, in one device. 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKCDLk9irkQ">SIMPLEX</a> <br>
Simplex is when signals travel in one direction and one direction only.(TV, radio, garage door, car key fob, wireless microphone)

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKCDLk9irkQ">HALF-DUPLEX</a> <br>
Half-duplex transmission is when signals travel in both directions, but one at a time. Both trasnmitter and receiver can send signals, but they must take turns. One example is walkie-talkie.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKCDLk9irkQ">FULL-DUPLEX</a> <br>
Full-duplex is two-way communications and signals travel in both directions simultaneously. (Telephone)


** Hubs and Switches are used to exchange data within a local area network. Not used to exchange data outside their own network. To exchange data outside their own network, a device needs to be able to read I.P. adresses.  We need router!

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z0ULvg_pW8&t=129s">HUB</a> <br>
Only detects that a device is physically connected to it.Data is copied to all other ports.Creates unnecessary traffic.Security! A layer 1 (Physical) device: One collision domain one broadcast domain. All nodes share the bandwith of network.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck3gx9HB9-k">COLLISION DOMAIN</a><br>
In an Ethernet network, a collision domain a group of nodes that can hear each other. Collisions occur when two noedes on a shared network segment send packets simultaneously.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z0ULvg_pW8&t=129s">SWITCH</a> <br>
Can detect specific devices that are connected to it. Keeps a record of the MAC addresses of those devices.
Switch is intelligent. Stores physical addresses. DAta directed only to intended port. Reduces unnecessary traffic. A layer 2 (Data Link) device: separates collision domains, creates a broadcast domain, gives every conversation the full bandwith of the network.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck3gx9HB9-k">BROADCAST DOMAIN</a><br>
A broadcast domain is a collection of network devices that recieve broadcast traffic from each other. A broadcast means that we send someting that everyone receives, whether they need/want it or not. Any node using 12F (MAC address: FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF) is broadcasting. Any other node can hear broadcast.

PDU <br>
“PDU (Protocol Data Unit)”. Irrespective of whether you are talking about network layer, transport layer or physical layer, the term PDU is generic and applies to all.

SEGMENT <br>
PDU at Transport layer is called as segments. Port numbers are part of Segments.

PACKET <br>
PDU at network layer is called as Packet. IP addresses are part of a Packet.

FRAME <br>
PDU at data link layer is called as Frame. MAC addresses are part of Frames.

BITS <br>
The Physical layer receives the frames and converts them into bits to be put on the network medium.
